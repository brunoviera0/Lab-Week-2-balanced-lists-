To compile the main program, use the following command in your terminal or command prompt, substituting "executable" with whatever name you'd like for your main program executable: "g++ -std=c++11 -o executable mainFunc.cpp fisher_yates.cpp prefixSum.cpp." Once compiled, you can run your program by entering ./executable in the terminal.

To compile the unit tests, use the command "g++ -std=c++11 -o "executable" tests.cpp fisher_yates.cpp prefixSum.cpp, replacing "executable" with a name of your choice for the test executable. After compilation, run your unit tests with the command 
 ./executable in the terminal.
